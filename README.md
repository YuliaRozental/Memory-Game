# Milestone-Project-1

Project Description

I want to create a memory game. The object of the game is to repeat a series of random tile clicks created by the game. After each round, the sequence becomes progressively longer and more complex (longer sequences, faster flashing) which makes it harder to remember. Player needs to recall the correct sequence – the order in which the squares illuminate and get a score. 

Game Logic

1. Let’s say there are 9 squares in the grid (3x3)
2. The user is confronted with a grid of empty squares
3. A round begins when the user clicks the 'start' button. Game activates one or more tiles in a random order and ends when the player reproduces the order by pressing the tiles. On the next round, the number of tiles in the sequence increases by one.
4. The user must correctly replicate this sequence in order to pass the level
5. If player was able to recall the sequence correctly the score will be incresed by 1 otherwise the score won't change. 


Deliverables

MVP Criteria
1. Player must be able to complete the whole 9 square flashing sequence 
2. Game must alert the player if he didn't repeat the sequence correctly
3. Cards must illumination and move more quickly. Making it harder to memorize or recollect the correct pattern.
3. Game must alert the player about the score after each round completed




Post-MVP Plans

1. Add more squares (4X4)
2. Cnahge the style of the cards 
3. Add interesting music or sound effects to your game
