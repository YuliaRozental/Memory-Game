# Milestone-Project-1

Project Description

I want to create a memory game. The game is about recalling the correct sequence and repeat it. Player needs to recall the correct sequence – the order in which the squares illuminate and get a score. Each level gets more difficult (longer sequences, faster flashing) making it harder to memorize or recollect the correct pattern.

Game Logic

1. Let’s say there are 16 squares in the grid (4x4)
2. The user is confronted with a grid of empty squares
3. When user click the 'start' button a sequence is “flashed” to the user, so the squares illuminate in turn in a particular order or sequence
5. The first round could start with one square illuminates and then the number of flashing cards will be progressively increasing from round to round (2, 3, 4, etc.)
7. The user must correctly replicate this sequence in order to pass the level
8. If player was able to recall the sequence correctly the score will be incresed by 1 otherwise the score won't change. 


Deliverables

MVP Criteria
1. Player must be able to complete the whole 16 square flashing sequence 
2. Game must alert the player if he didn't repeat the sequence correctly
3. Cards must illumination and move more quickly. Making it harder to memorize or recollect the correct pattern.
3. Game must alert the player about the score after each round completed

Post-MVP Plans

1. Maybe adding more squares
2. Maybe making a few parrallel sequenses with different colors of the squares
